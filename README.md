# Data Visualization Presentation

A presentation on data visualization in general aimed at sort of technical audiences.

## Abstract

This presentation will give an overview of what data visualization is along with tools, techniques, and resources for successful visualizations.  We will go through some of the basic concepts of what data visualization is and what makes a visualization successful, look at real examples, and then go through tools and resources that will help build visualizations.

Alan Palazzolo is an interactive news developer for MinnPost, an online, non-profit newspaper focused on Minnesota, where he helps in building news applications as well as data visualization to enhance or accompany stories.

## Just Notes for now

the remarkable mechanisms by which the senses understand the environment are all but identical with the operations described by the psychology of thinking.
—Rudolf Arnheim, from Visual Thinking


“I see!”
Her expression makes complete sense, because deep inside our minds, to see and 
to understand are intertwined processes. We understand  because we see.

Inforgaphics is more presentation than exploration, Visualization is opposite


data viz is communication, not art


form vs function (both)



 the relationship between visualization and art, which is similar to the linkage of journalism and literature.
A journalist can borrow tools and techniques from literature, and be inspired 
by great fiction writing, but she will never allow her stories to become literature. 
That notion applies to visualization, which is, above all, a functional art.

The first and main goal of any graphic and visualization is to be a tool for your eyes and brain to perceive 
what lies beyond their natural reach.

Rise in visualization:  cognitive thinking research, data, and tools


Information overload.  Information anxiety.  Information diet.  Data vs knowledge.

(Functional art vs fine art)
The fact that an information graphic is designed to help us complete certain 
intellectual tasks is what distinguishes it from fine art.  Rather than serving as 
a means for the artist to express her inner world and feelings, an infographic 
or visualization strives for objectivity, precision and functionality, as well as 
beauty. In short:
The function constrains the form.

Effective analytic designs entail turning thinking principles into seeing 
principles. So, if the thinking task is to understand causality, the task calls 
for a design principle: “Show causality.” If a thinking task is to answer a 
question and compare it with alternatives, the design principle is: “Show 
comparisons.” The point is that analytical designs are not to be decided on 
their convenience to the user or necessarily their readability or what psychologists or decorators think about them; rather, design architectures should be 
decided on how the architecture assists analytical thinking about evidence.
